PMEG Template Generator

Proof of Concept for Physician-Modified Endograft Template Generation

A web-based tool that allows surgeons to design fenestrations on vascular grafts and generate printable templates for precise modification during procedures.

🎯 Purpose

This prototype demonstrates a simplified workflow for creating physician-modified endografts (PMEG):

Digital Design - Select graft dimensions and place fenestrations
Template Generation - Convert 3D design to printable 2D template
Physical Application - Print template and use as cutting guide
🚀 Live Demo

✨ Features

Interactive Graft Designer - Click to place fenestrations on 3D cylinder view
Real-time Template Preview - See unwrapped 2D template instantly
Customizable Parameters - Adjust graft diameter, length, and fenestration size
Printable Output - Generate actual-size templates for standard printers
Fenestration Management - Add, remove, and track multiple fenestrations
🛠️ How to Use

Configure Graft - Select diameter and length matching your device
Place Fenestrations - Click on the 3D graft view to add holes
Review Template - Check the 2D unwrapped template on the right
Print - Generate printable template at actual size
Apply - Sterilize paper template and use as cutting guide
💡 Concept

The software "unwraps" a cylindrical graft into a flat rectangle, preserving the precise positioning of fenestrations. Surgeons can:

Print the template on standard paper
Sterilize the template
Wrap it around the actual graft
Use holes as cutting guides
🔧 Technical Details
